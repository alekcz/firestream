## Status
Design and prototyping. Not suitable for any kind of usuage. 

## Design 
`firestream` is designed to provide kafakaesque streams with minimal hassle for pico-scale applications or MVPs. Once your application is no longer pico-scale using `firestream` is a great way to ensure bad things happen. `firestream` is aimed to give your application (or business) the runway grow enough to be able to absorb the operational cost of `kafka`. 

### Schema 
At both rest and in transit all messages are stored as stringified `json` objects. `firestream` itself works in `clojure` maps. 

### Topics and partitions
Partitions are not provided for in `firestream`. If you really really really need partitions, it's probably time to switch to `kafka`.

### Producers and consumers
Like `kafka`, `firestream` allows for multiple consumer and producers. It however only allows for consumer groups with one consumer. If you really really really need more than one consume in a consumer group, it's probably time to switch to `kafka`.

### Brokers and clusters
There is only one broker, that broker is your firebase instance. There is only cluster

### Interface
The design of `firestream`'s interface is inspired by [pyr's](https://github.com/pyr) somewhat opinionated client library for `kafka` [kinsky](https://github.com/pyr/kinsky).

### Why firebase

"Once connectivity is reestablished, we'll receive the appropriate set of events so that the client "catches up" with the current server state, without having to write any custom code." - Peeps from Firebase

[Offline writes](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/save-data#section-writes-offline)


## Limits
The theoretical limits* of `firestream` (i.e. running it on the biggest machine you can find) are derived by using an 8th of the limits of firebase. For pico-scale applications or MVPs it's unlikely you'll hit the limits of firebase or `firestream`. Here they are anyway:

- Combined maximum number of consumers and producers: 24k
- Maximum system throughput (reads and writes): ~12k per second
- Maximum payload during write: 2MB
- Maximum write speed: 8MB per second
- Maximum payload size at rest: 1.25MB
- Maximmum payload during read: 32MB
- Maximum number of messages per topic: 9 million
- Broker timeout: 60 minutes

*It's quite likely that you can get more perf than the above, but better safe than sorry.

## Installation

You can grab `firestream` from clojars: [alekcz/firestream "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"].


### Setting up firebase

1. You need to create a project on [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to get started. So do that first.
2. Once you've created your project setup a Realtime Database.
3. We don't want any frontends or non-admin apps to access our database, as this database will be at the core of our stream. So we need to deny all non-admin access using the [firebase securtiy rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/quickstart). You can use the rules below.
```javascript
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": false, //block all non-admin reads
    ".write": false //block all non-admin writes
  }
}
```

### Connecting your app to firebase

1. Get the `json` file containing your creditials by following the instruction here [https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup)  

2. Set the GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment to the firebase id of your project e.g. "alekcz-test"

3. Set the FIREBASE_CONFIG environment variable to the contents of your `json` key file. (Sometimes it may be necessary to wrap the key contents in single quotes to escape all the special characters within it. e.g. FIREBASE_CONFIG='`contents-of-json`')

4. You're now good to go.

## Usage

The `firestream` API has 5 functions. 
- `producer`: Create a producer
- `send!`: Send new message to topic
- `consumer`: Create a consumer
- `subscribe!`: Subscribe to a topic
- `poll!`: Read messages ready for consumption


## Metrics

There are no metrics for the moment, but hopefully someday we'll get to the same level as [operatr.io](https://operatr.io/). 

## What next

When you outgrow `firestream` and are ready for `kafka`, hit up the awesome folks at [troywest.com](https://troywest.com/) to get you started.
