Kafkaesque streams built on firebase

## Installation

### Connecting to firebase

1. Get the `json` file containing your creditials by following the instruction here [https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup)  

2. Set the GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment to the id of your project

3. Set the FIREBASE_CONFIG environment variable to the contents of your `json` key file. (Sometimes it may be necessary to wrap the key contents in single quotes to escape all the special characters within it. e.g. FIREBASE_CONFIG='`contents-of-json`')

4. You're now good to go.

## Usage

Chill, it's still early days.
